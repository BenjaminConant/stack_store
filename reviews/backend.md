# JavaScript Style

- Good JS style in backend code
- Good use of seed file
- Remove things.js

# Database

### Validations

+ Good use of validations, nice formatting of model files

### Schema Design

- Item
    + Why the array of Object IDs for Reviews?
    + purchaseHistory?  Purpose and use?
    + Stars probably doesn't belong here unless you mean it to be a calculated value
    + Price should be stored in cents, not decimal
- Line Item
    + What if the receiver is also a user, is that a use case you want to support?
    + message/longMessage?
- Order is not attached to user -> preferable to storing it in the User model
- Stripe Schema?  Looks like you used the endpoint to create something for the controller?

# Node.js

### Routes

- Appear to be using standard routing generated by endpoint
- No authentication yet, what are plans for locking down Admin versus regular views?


### Controllers

- Appears standard generated.
- Orders look good
